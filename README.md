# Node TS starter

Base files needed for probably any Node project written with Typescript, as of June 2023. Just copy those files over and do the following:

- Change the app name at the top of `package.json`
- Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

## NPM commands configured:

- `build`: compiles files to `dist`
- `dev`: compiles to `dist` and runs `dist/index.js`

## What to do now?

Start coding in `src`. When you want to run your script type `npm run dev`, when you want to build files for distribution run `npm run build` and deploy files in `dist`.
There would be more to do for proper prod stuffs, but this will be useful in simple day to day or small scale scripts.
